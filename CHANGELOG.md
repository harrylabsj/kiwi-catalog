# Changelog

## 0.5.3 — 2026-09-30

- Move the merchant portal HTML pages (`/portal/*`, `handlers/portal.py`, `handlers/portal_kit.py`) out of the package: they are provided by the private `kiwi-catalog-admin` extension. Core keeps only the `/v1` business APIs. This is the same move that was released as 0.5.1 but was never merged into `main`, so 0.5.2 re-shipped the in-package portal — whose base routes shadow the extension's routes and silently reverted merchant pages on hosts that installed it.
- Guard the public-package boundary in tests: no `/portal*` route, no portal handler module, and no `admin_reports` reference may return to the package.
- Keep the 0.5.2 `GET /v1/accounts/me/service-status` API in the route table.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-09-29

- Include the read-only `GET /v1/accounts/me/service-status` API for merchant onboarding, publication, heartbeat presence, and product-quota status.
- Prepare the package version for the protected portfolio PyPI release. Production hosts must install this release from PyPI only.
